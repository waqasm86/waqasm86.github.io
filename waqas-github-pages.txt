Let me fetch both the live site and the repository to understand the current structure.
I should:

Fetch the live GitHub Pages site to see what's currently published
Look at the repository structure to understand the content organization
Identify unnecessary or confusing material
Suggest improvements for clarity and focus
Help reorganize to make projects simple to follow

Let me check one of the project detail pages to see how much content is there.Failed to fetch https://waqasm86.github.io/projects/cuda-nvidia-systems-engg/Thought processI'm getting permission errors on these URLs. However, I have enough information from what I've already fetched to provide good recommendations. Based on:

The homepage shows 2 featured projects (llcuda and cuda-nvidia-systems-engg)
The projects page lists 6 projects total
Some of these 6 projects are components that were integrated into cuda-nvidia-systems-engg

The main issues I can identify:

Redundancy: Several listed projects (cuda-tcp-llama.cpp, cuda-openmpi, cuda-mpi-llama-scheduler, cuda-llm-storage-pipeline) are component projects that became part of cuda-nvidia-systems-engg
Lack of focus: Having 6 projects dilutes the impact when really there are 2-3 main projects
Missing llcuda prominence: llcuda (PyPI package) should be front and center as it's the most product-focused

Let me create a clear, actionable recommendation document.Based on what I can see from your GitHub Pages site, here's my analysis and recommendations:
Current Issues Identified
1. Project Redundancy
Your projects page lists 6 CUDA projects, but several are component projects that were integrated into cuda-nvidia-systems-engg:

cuda-tcp-llama.cpp → became TCP networking component
cuda-mpi-llama-scheduler → became MPI scheduling component
cuda-llm-storage-pipeline → became storage component
cuda-openmpi → became integration testing

This creates confusion - visitors don't know if these are separate projects or components.
2. Diluted Focus
Having 6 projects weakens your portfolio impact. You really have 3 main projects:

llcuda - PyPI package (product-focused)
cuda-nvidia-systems-engg - Production C++ system (systems-focused)
local-llama-cuda - (unclear what this adds)

3. Buried Lead
llcuda (your PyPI package) should be the star of your portfolio for LM Studio, but it's not prominently featured on the projects page.
Recommended Simplification
Homepage (index.md)
Keep it clean - looks good! Maybe add a clearer value proposition:

Would you like me to create the updated markdown files for you to replace in your repository?Following up, take the following into consideration. 
1. Make llcuda the star project but complement it with Ubuntu-Cuda-Llama.cpp-Executable becuase llcuda cannot work without Ubuntu-Cuda-Llama.cpp-Executable . This will be one massive project.  This project revolves around ubuntu 22 and old nvidia gpu like mine. I will prefer to create github pages website dedicated to llcuda python pip package. Remove all the unneccesaryprojects. The following are my links.
