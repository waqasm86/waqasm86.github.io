## Reporting Bugs

When reporting bugs, please include:

**System Information:**
```bash
# Python version
python3 --version

# llcuda version
python3 -c "import llcuda; print(llcuda.__version__)"

# GPU information
nvidia-smi

# OS information
cat /etc/os-release
```

**Error Details:**
- Full error message
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Minimal code example

**Example Bug Report:**
```
**Title**: CUDA out of memory with Gemma 2 2B on GTX 1050

**System**:
- llcuda version: 0.1.5
- Python: 3.10.12
- GPU: GeForce GTX 1050 (2GB VRAM)
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04

**Issue**:
Getting CUDA OOM error when loading Gemma 2 2B model.

**Code**:
from llcuda import LLM
llm = LLM(model="gemma-2-2b-it")  # Fails here

**Error**:
RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory...

**Expected**: Should work on 2GB VRAM
**Actual**: OOM error
```

## Feature Requests

I welcome feature requests! Please provide:

**Use Case**: Why do you need this feature?
**Description**: What should it do?
**Example**: How would you use it?
**Priority**: Is this blocking your work?

**Example Feature Request:**
```
**Feature**: Support for Q2_K quantization

**Use Case**: Need to run larger models on 1GB VRAM GPU

**Description**: Add support for Q2_K quantization to fit
larger models in limited VRAM.

**Example**:
llm = LLM(model="llama-7b", quantization="Q2_K")

**Priority**: Nice to have, not blocking
```

## Thank You

Thank you for your interest in my work! I built llcuda to make LLM development accessible on hardware people already own, and your feedback helps make it better.

Whether you're:
- A student learning AI
- A developer building applications
- A researcher exploring LLMs
- Someone with an old GPU wanting to experiment

**I'm here to help.**

Looking forward to hearing from you!
